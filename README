Enter up to four strings and their replacements in the Configuration Manager.  Then set the 'do_replace'
option to true.  When the page is loaded into the editor the plugn will do the search and 
replacement.  

The plugin keeps track of the pages which it has processed and will not re-process the same page twice
during the same search and replace session.  To start a new session, set the 'do_replace' option to false,
save the updated configuration, then reset it to true and again save.

The plugin also accepts regular expressions, which must be marked with open and closing hashes:
    #regex#
The regex can include parenthesized options, consistent with PHP's use of PCRE,e.g. (?i) to
set case insensitivity.
